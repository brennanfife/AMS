## Value proposition

- The ‘metaverse’ is defined as a network of **connected** virtual worlds (with a focus on games and social connections). However, it is becoming anything but; it’s slowly demonstrating how fractured it is (and will become more so for years to come). This will (likely) lead to an array of potential problems, including a lack of undefined standards, loss of exponential opportunities, and ultimately, is ‘anti-composable’, an idea that goes against the web 3 philosophy.
- AMS looks to create better discussion around virtual world standards and composability; by starting with the use of AMS tokens, primitive, non-opinionated virtual addresses (in the form of NFTs), all built on top of ENS addresses.
- Owners of an AMS NFT will take their assets from project to project. New ‘metaverses’ can build on AMS, creating new networks, games, skins, etc. on top. 
- It's extremely important for the project to follow in ENS’s **extremely** ‘open-ethos’ approach. As a result, not only will the confidence of project developers (who are incorporating AMS) improve, but the owners of an AMS NFT will notice an upgrade in the project's longevity.
- To best scale the project, there will be no cap on the number of AMS tokens, but will be slowly released in batches.
- AMS will be incorporated as a DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, to be directed by its most active community members.
