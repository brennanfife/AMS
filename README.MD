## Value proposition

- The ‘metaverse’ is defined as a network of connected virtual worlds, focused on social connections. However, it is anything but; it’s becoming extremely fractured (and will become even more so for years to come). This leads to an array of problems, including undefined standards, loss of exponential opportunities, and ultimately, is ‘anti-composable’, an idea that goes against the web 3 philosophy.
- AMS looks to create better discussion around better, 3D-world composability and standards; by starting with the use of AMS tokens, primitive, non-opinionated virtual addresses in the form of NFTs, all built on-top of ENS addresses...
- AMS to follow in ENS’s extremely ‘open-ethos’ approach
- New ‘metaverse’ projects build on AMS, creating their own games, skins, etc. on top
