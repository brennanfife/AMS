## Value proposition

- The ‘metaverse’ is defined as a network of **connected** virtual worlds, with an orientated focus towards games and social connections. However, it is anything but; it’s becoming fractured (and will become more so for years to come). This will likely lead to an array of potential problems, including undefined standards, loss of exponential opportunities, and ultimately, is ‘anti-composable’, an idea that goes against the web 3 philosophy.
- AMS looks to create better discussion around better, 3D-world composability and standards; by starting with the use of AMS tokens, primitive, non-opinionated virtual addresses in the form of NFTs, all built on top of ENS addresses...
- AMS to follow in ENS’s extremely ‘open-ethos’ approach
- New ‘metaverse’ projects build on AMS, creating games, skins, etc. on top
